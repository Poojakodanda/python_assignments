    "The read() would treat each character in the file separately, meaning that the iteration would happen for every character.\n",
    "The readline() function, on the other hand, only reads a single line of the file. This means that if the first line of the file were three lines long, the readline() function would only parse (or iterate/operate) on the first line of the file."
